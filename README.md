# sfml_pathfinding
Pathfinding alghorithms and visualizations in SFML.

On Windows:

1 -  Follow the "SFML compile" portion in the guide I linked, except create a new designated folder for the source code of SFML,
and create the build folder in this folder

https://gist.github.com/Mulperi/453ee95463fdb5aea886aef6207d68fc

2 - Copy the .dll files from /build/lib to the root folder

3 - Copy the source files from this repo to the root folder

4 - Make with mingw32-make

This should work.


Folder should look something like this: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83160118/166161031-88431a3b-9fc2-4203-917e-6d86c3c4782c.png)
