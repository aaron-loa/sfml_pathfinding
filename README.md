# sfml_pathfinding
Pathfinding alghorithms and visualizations in SFML.

On Windows:
1 -  Follow the "SFML compile" portion in this guide, except create new designated folder for the source code of SFML,
and create the build folder in this folder

https://gist.github.com/Mulperi/453ee95463fdb5aea886aef6207d68fc
2 - Copy the .dll files from /build/lib to the root folder
3 - Copy the files from this repo to the root folder
4 - Compile with mingw32-make
This works for me.
Folder should look something like this ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83160118/166160907-8092d43f-fd64-4473-a4a5-6b45b8288f79.png)
